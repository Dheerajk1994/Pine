# Pine
Pine is a light-weight wrapper around Android Util's Log. 

## Features So Far:
### Multiple Log Levels:
Pine comes with multiple log levels that can be selected from for better control. This allows developers to customize the type of logs a production ready build will put out compared to a debug build.
### Tagless Logging:
Logging do not require tags. Pine will customize the tag for you and will print the exact location from where the log was called.
### Stepping:
A convenient stepping function that allows you to track the flow of your application. Big thanks to fellow iOS developer Jeff Garner for this idea.

## What's next?
I am currenlty working on releasing this into maven-central.
